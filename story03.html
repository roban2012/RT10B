 Fitch: Rebalancing Central for China's Sovereign Ratings <br><br>   
15 Oct 2013 6:01 AM (EDT)<br><br>
Fitch Ratings-Hong Kong-15 October 2013: The key structural vulnerability facing China's credit profile is the unsustainability of the investment-driven growth model. The longer investment and leverage remain on an unsustainable path, the greater the risk to the sovereign credit profile and ratings, Fitch says in a report published today.<br><br>

China's Foreign-Currency Issuer Default Rating (IDR) has risen to 'A+'/Stable as of October 2013 from 'A-'/Stable when the rating was first assigned in December 1997. The upgrades reflect strengthening in the balance sheet and the economy's astonishing growth. However, momentum has stalled since the upgrade to 'A+' from 'A' in November 2007 because structural vulnerabilities have come to the fore.<br><br>

Capital formation rose to account for 48.1% of GDP in 2012 - unprecedented for any large emerging market. If investment continues to grow faster than GDP, it would soon exceed domestic savings (50.8% of GDP in 2012) - and China would sink into a trade deficit, dependent on capital inflows to fund growth. Fitch believes the authorities are determined to avoid such an outcome.<br><br>

Investment and debt are closely connected and Fitch believes China has a debt problem to match its extraordinarily high investment rate. The stock of debt in China's economy has surged to around 200% of GDP at end-2012 from 129% at end-2008 when the authorities unleashed a credit-fuelled stimulus. The agency believes no economy can operate indefinitely with a rising leverage ratio - another reason why growth is on an unsustainable path.<br><br>

There has been no progress in rebalancing the economy away from investment towards consumption, year to date. Investment contributed 4.1 percentage points (pp) of China's 7.6% growth in H113, against 3.4pp from consumption. Credit continues to grow faster than GDP: the flow of new "total social financing" was up 30.6% year-on-year in H113 while nominal GDP rose by 8.8%. Fitch believes China faces a process of structural economic adjustment - which could be bumpy. Moreover, some of the costs of fixing China's debt problem are likely to fall on the sovereign.<br><br>

China has a busy policy-making calendar through to the National People's Congress in March 2014. Evidence that the authorities are abandoning rebalancing and reform in favour of "more of the same" growth would be negative for the sovereign ratings.<br><br>

Conversely, a lengthening track record of rebalancing without economic or financial instability could lay the foundations for positive rating action in recognition of China's other credit strengths. The case for positive action would be strengthened if China's legacy debt problem from the 2008-2012 credit surge were tackled convincingly.<br><br>

	<hr><br>

    Fitch: Eurozone Fiscal Governance Progresses, Challenges Remain  <br><br>
17 Oct 2013 9:20 AM (EDT) Fitch Ratings-London-17 October 2013: The submission of 2014 draft budgets by the 17 members of the eurozone to the European Commission is an important step towards deeper fiscal and financial integration in the single currency bloc, Fitch Ratings says. Progress towards deeper integration underpins our sovereign ratings for those countries and is in line with commitments by euro area policy makers.<br><br>

But the new budgetary surveillance system also demonstrates some of the challenges that this process will face.<br><br>

The Commission will review the budgets by the end of November and publish its opinion on the compliance with fiscal rules. It can publicly request the revision of any budget deemed out of line with medium-term targets. 15 October was the deadline for eurozone members to publish draft budgets for review under the so-called "Two Pack" regulations that came into force at the end of May.<br><br>

In line with the new rules, the Commission's assessment will focus on the structural fiscal position, filtering out cyclical and one-off effects. However, the calculation of the structural position, especially measuring the output gap in real time, is analytically challenging and several issues have been raised by the European Central Bank regarding the Commission's methodology. A fiscal rule that is not based on a directly observable target is less transparent.<br><br>

For example, according to Italy's draft budget the structural deficit in 2013 will be only 0.4% of the GDP, while the headline deficit will be very close to 3%. Financing needs are determined by headline deficits that remain wide in all periphery countries, and ultimately drive debt dynamics and determine debt sustainability. Economic growth also remains vitally important in securing debt sustainability.<br><br>

In its latest Eurozone Snapshot, Fitch forecast debt to continue to increase beyond 2015 in Cyprus, Spain, Portugal, Slovenia and the Netherlands.<br><br>

Medium-term public debt projections remain a key factor driving our individual sovereign ratings, but the new budgetary surveillance process is also part of the moves to reform and enhance economic governance in the eurozone as a whole. The fact that this week's deadline was met by all eurozone members suggests a strong commitment to the new enhanced fiscal framework. But the real test of its effectiveness will be to improve debt sustainability in all member states, and that has yet to be seen.<br><br>

 Fitch: Asia Sovereign Ratings Resilient to US Negative Watch  <br><br>
18 Oct 2013 2:06 AM (EDT) Fitch Ratings-Hong Kong/London/Singapore-18 October 2013: The recent assignment of Rating Watch Negative on the US's AAA sovereign ratings is unlikely to lead directly to downgrades of any Asian sovereigns, even though these are among the largest holders of US Treasuries, says Fitch Ratings. US Treasuries are likely to remain among the most liquid financial instruments, and so would continue to underpin Asian external liquidity and sovereign credit profiles.<br><br>

Asian sovereign credit profiles have generally benefited from a strengthening of their foreign-currency balance sheets since the Asian Financial Crisis in 1997-1998. This has been driven by a rapid pace of reserve accumulation by most countries in the region, up until 2011.<br><br>

The growth in foreign-currency reserves has subsequently slowed. Moreover, this has recently dropped from a year ago in countries such as India, Indonesia, Mongolia and Sri Lanka, due to twin deficit pressures and lower net capital inflows.<br><br>

Nonetheless, regional reserves remain an important buffer against external shocks, and therefore underpin overall sovereign creditworthiness. This factor is not eroded by the Rating Watch Negative on the US's AAA sovereign rating.<br><br>

At end-July 2013, Asian governments owned around 26% of the total marketable Treasury debt. The largest holders were China and Japan, with 11% and 10%, respectively. Nine other Asian sovereigns held 5%.<br><br>

The latest data show that China and Japan have among the world's largest reserves - USD3.6trn and USD1.2trn, respectively. The foreign-reserve positions of countries such as Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore and India remain among the largest in the world - in excess of USD200bn. At end-September, IMF data showed that 62% of global reserves for which a currency breakdown is provided is held in US dollars. <br><br>

	<b><a name="T4">Japan Hikes Consumption Tax, But Fiscal Risks Persist</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>

Japan Hikes Consumption Tax, But Fiscal Risks Persist<br><br>
Fitch Ratings-Hong Kong/Singapore-02 October 2013: Japan's consumption tax hike, announced yesterday, is in line with Fitch Ratings' expectation, and does not by itself lead to a re-assessment of the Negative Outlook on the 'A+' sovereign rating. The tax hike does signal a commitment to fiscal consolidation as a policy objective. For now, however, the process of budget deficit reduction remains slow and fragile amid unclear effects of accompanying structural reforms.
<br><br>
The tax increase, from 5% to 8% with effect from April 2014, is the first of a two-step process which is expected to reach 10% by 2015. This is also the centerpiece of the government's long-term plan for halving its primary budget deficit by FY15 from the FY10 level, and stabilising its debt burden by FY20. Yet there will be only a limited short-term impact on the sovereign rating for two reasons.<br><br>

One is that the pace of fiscal consolidation remains slow even in comparison with Japan's fiscally challenged high-grade peers. In our base-case scenario, government debt stabilises at 250% of GDP (from 239%), but no earlier than 2020. In comparison, France and the UK are likely to stabilise their debt burdens at lower levels, and much sooner - by 2014 and 2016, respectively (although the UK and France are more highly rated, at 'AA+').
<br><br>
Moreover, the near-term impact on the public finances is likely to be mitigated by some offsetting fiscal easing to smooth the effect on growth, although the details have yet to be determined.
<br><br>
Another reason is the lingering danger of fiscal slippage. This is due to two key risks. First, whether offsetting measures in this fiscal year will be reversed in a timely fashion so as not to erode the medium-term fiscal impact of the hike. A second risk would be non-implementation of the proposed extension of the sales tax to 10% by 2015.
<br><br>
The tax rise is in line with our base case, so there is not much in yesterday's announcement to alter our Negative Outlook on Japan's sovereign ratings.
<br><br>
Nonetheless, Fitch thinks Abenomics could result in the Outlook reverting to Stable. The central issue is to what extent structural reforms and supportive monetary policies can result in - and sustain - higher nominal and real GDP growth. In this respect, the following two evolving economic trends are particularly important:
<br><br>
First, whether wage growth accelerates and sets off a self-sustaining inflationary process; and, finally, whether tax incentives and other supply-side measures induce businesses to raise investment and ultimately boost the real GDP growth rate.<br><br>

Recent data point to a pick-up in GDP, inflation and employment. Fitch has revised up its growth forecasts for Japan in 2013 and 2014 since the end of last year even while lowering the forecasts for the US, EU and emerging markets. Moreover, monetary and credit conditions remain easy, and business confidence has also risen. However, sustained increases in core inflation, wages and business investment have yet to materialise.
<br><br>
The upshot is that yesterday's consumption tax hike is a necessary but as-yet insufficient condition for a lasting improvement in Japan's sovereign credit profile. Much depends on how inflation expectations, wage increases and corporate investment shape up. Constructive developments on these fronts could also help limit the medium-term risk of fiscal setbacks.<br><br>

	<b><a name="T5">Stricter U.S Bank Liquidity Rules to Affect Profitability</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
25 Oct 2013 10:55 AM<br><br>
Stricter U.S Bank Liquidity Rules to Affect Profitability<br><br>
Fitch Ratings-Chicago-25 October 2013: The proposed U.S. rule covering minimum liquidity requirements for large banks would enforce a tougher standard than the Basel III international framework outlined in January. Fitch Ratings sees the proposed U.S. rule as generally positive for bank credit ratings. However, the push for additional liquidity will negatively affect bank profitability if the proposal is implemented.<br><br>
The proposal, issued yesterday by the Fed, OCC and FDIC, seeks to implement the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR), which has been developed together with global bank regulators. It will require large banks with more than $250 billion of total assets to hold high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) at sufficient levels to guard against a 30-day period of strained liquidity. Further, banks with more than $50 billion of total assets (but less than $250 billion) will have to hold enough HQLA to withstand a 21-day period of liquidity stress. Smaller banks (less than $50 billion of assets) will get a reprieve from the LCR.<br><br>

To achieve compliance with the proposed LCR, Fitch believes banks would likely need to derisk their investment portfolios and move towards very liquid lower-yielding government and agency securities. The U.S. standard goes further than the Basel III framework in excluding certain assets from the pool of HQLA. Among these are private label mortgage-backed securities, covered bonds and municipal securities. Fitch estimates that roughly 25% of bank investment portfolios could be excluded from the definition of HQLA based on second-quarter regulatory data.
<br><br>
Alternatively, banks could target LCR compliance by attacking the denominator in the equation. Banks could procure longer, term-funding structures to help achieve compliance by reducing deposit outflow risk. Nevertheless, Fitch views either derisking investment portfolios or longer, term-funding structures as a drag on profitability for most banks.
<br><br>
Under the proposal, level 1 securities receive no haircut, and are generally limited to cash, central bank deposits, U.S. Treasury obligations and U.S agency securities fully and explicitly guaranteed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government, such as Ginnie Mae securities. Other government-sponsored entity (GSE) securities, such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac securities, will qualify as level 2A securities, with a 15% haircut. Level 2B securities are given a 50% haircut and are generally limited to investment-grade corporate debt and common stock included in the S&P 500.
<br><br>
The U.S. proposal takes a stricter approach with respect to the LCR implementation timeline. U.S regulators look to expedite the implementation of the rule by requiring banks to achieve 80% compliance with the LCR by 2015, with increases of 10% for the following two years and full implementation by 2017. The international standard only requires 60% compliance in 2015, followed by a 10% increase for the following four years (full implementation in 2019).
<br><br>
The proposal also takes a tougher stance on intra-period liquidity requirements. The U.S. proposal requires that the largest banks (more than $250 billion) to hold HQLA against their largest net cumulative cash outflow day within a 30-day liquidity stress period, rather than the net cumulative cash outflow as of the end of the period. This represents the regulator's view that cash outflows could occur significantly before cash inflows within a 30-day liquidity stress period.
<br><br>
Fed staff noted that HQLA levels in the aggregate currently are approximately $200 billion below the targeted level for LCR compliance. However, we believe the two-year window for compliance will provide adequate time for banks to boost liquid assets where needed.
<br><br>
In addition to the LCR, U.S. banking regulators are still considering and developing a proposal for the net stable funding ratio (NSFR) in conjunction with global bank regulators, which promotes durability of liquidity over a one-year period. The global implementation date for the NSFR is 2018.<br><br>

	<b><a name="T6">US Industrial Earnings Underscore Tough Growth Prospects</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
24 Oct 2013 3:20 PM<br><br>
US Industrial Earnings Underscore Tough Growth Prospects<br><br>
Fitch Ratings-New York-24 October 2013: The latest round of earnings from U.S. industrial companies, including Caterpillar Inc. (CAT) and Honeywell International Inc. reflects a slow growth global environment, according to Fitch Ratings. Overall slow growth mirrors mixed conditions in end markets for U.S. industrials while higher interest rates could limit demand in some financing-dependent sectors.<br><br>

Challenges facing the U.S. industrial sector and others include ongoing concerns with Eurozone economies and low consumer demand in China and other emerging markets. Meanwhile, uncertainty surrounding U.S. monetary policy remains a focus as the climate in Washington is divisive.<br><br>

Fitch thinks a weak recovery in the Eurozone will follow as gains in competitiveness and rebalancing bear fruit, fiscal consolidation eases, and financing conditions normalize. We believe economic rebalancing in China and tighter global monetary conditions have exacerbated domestic structural vulnerabilities and difficult policy trade-offs. Fitch now expects growth in China to slow to 7.0% in 2014 (from our 7.5% estimate previously), from 7.5% in 2013.
<br><br>
We expect global economic growth to increase in 2H13 and 2014-2015. GDP in major advanced economies will expand by 0.9% in 2013, 1.8% in 2014, and 2.1% in 2015. Nevertheless, we have revised downward our forecast for world GDP growth to 2.3% in 2013 (from 2.4% in the June Global Economic Outlook), 2.9% in 2014 (from 3.1%) and 3.2% in 2015 (unchanged), partly reflecting a softer than expected tone in U.S. data but also reduced forecasts for many emerging market countries - underscoring their growing weight in the global economy.
<br><br>
CAT reported poor third quarter earnings as well as a cut in its 2013 profit forecast. The company expects that 2014 could be a better year for global economic growth, but stated that significant risks and uncertainties could alter that forecast. CAT also thinks that China's transition to a more consumer-led economy could affect global growth.
<br><br>
In its Wednesday conference call, CAT said that sales and revenue expectations are lower across most of the company as mining remains difficult to forecast. The company said it is still not receiving nearly as many mining orders as expected. Despite higher mine production around the world, new orders for mining equipment remain low.
<br><br>
The global metals and mining sector has entered a period of retrenchment as deteriorating fundamentals and overexpansion have led to weak shareholder returns, a string of multibillion dollar write-downs, management changes, and a renewed focus on living within cash flow means. The metals and mining complex has been hit by significant price weakness, driven by a slowdown in emerging market demand (in particular, China's projected growth), improved supply and weakness in developed market demand.
<br><br>
Honeywell also lowered its full-year sales forecast while its CEO said the company is planning for a continued slow-growth macro environment. The company is undertaking additional restructuring to support margins, and conditions in some end-markets are positive, such as commercial aerospace and certain of its UOP unit's petrochemical markets.

Given this environment, most Fitch rating outlooks in the U.S. industrial space remain stable, although negative outlooks outnumber positive outlooks. Fitch's industrial ratings are stressed to withstand another recession.
<br><br>
Negative revisions in revenue forecasts reflect our broader view that U.S. corporates will find it difficult to expand margins significantly in coming quarters. As we noted in the Oct. 16 Fitch Fundamentals Index report, EBITDA forecasts remain broadly constrained by limited top-line growth potential, scaled-back capex and diminishing expense reduction opportunities.

	<b><a name="T7">Gold Rebound Unlikely; Fall to USD1,000 May Hit Ratings</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
01 Oct 2013 10:07 AM<br><br>
Gold Rebound Unlikely; Fall to USD1,000 May Hit Ratings<br><br>

Link to Fitch Ratings' Report: Gold Company Ratings at USD1,200 a Troy Ounce<br><br>

Fitch Ratings-London-01 October 2013: The anticipated unwinding of US quantitative easing and expectations of improving but unspectacular economic growth leave little room for a rebound in gold prices over the next few years, while a further decline remains a real possibility, Fitch Ratings says.<br><br>

Our ratings of gold producers incorporate a base case gold price assumption of USD1,200 per troy ounce for the next two years, but a stress scenario of USD1,000/oz would put some gold miners' ratings under significant pressure without substantial cost cutting and cash conservation measures.<br><br>

Our base case price is in line with the industry's "all-in-sustaining" cost guidance for 2013. However we do not see USD1,200/oz as a price floor because recent price trends have been influenced far more by the use of gold as a financial instrument and a hedge against inflation than by industrial demand. Given the change in sentiment as central banks signal unwinding of economic stimulus, we recognise it is possible that the gold price could find a new floor below this level for an extended period. The gold price has currently settled above USD1,300/oz.<br><br>

We have reviewed our portfolio of gold producers following the recent sharp drop in prices, but have not taken any rating actions because we believe that, under our base case, companies have sufficient flexibility to reduce their operating cost base and capex plans. We also expect producers to reassess their dividend policies.<br><br>

The USD1,000/oz stress case is not used to determine ratings, but is a useful tool to assess the flexibility companies would have amid persistent weaker prices. Rising leverage would be inevitable in this scenario with Kinross (BBB-) and Nord Gold (BB-) showing peaks in 2014. Buenaventura (BBB) peaks in 2015 due to its projected investment in affiliates and brownfield expansion projects under this price scenario.<br><br>

Polyus Gold (BBB-) would probably remain the least leveraged Fitch-rated gold miner. But it would also probably see the biggest impact on EBITDA, due to the location of its production assets in regions of Russia with poor infrastructure and severe climate conditions, which would limit the potential for additional cost savings.<br><br>

Eurozone Fiscal Governance Progresses, Challenges Remain<br><br>
Fitch Ratings-London-17 October 2013: The submission of 2014 draft budgets by the 17 members of the eurozone to the European Commission is an important step towards deeper fiscal and financial integration in the single currency bloc, Fitch Ratings says. Progress towards deeper integration underpins our sovereign ratings for those countries and is in line with commitments by euro area policy makers.<br><br>

But the new budgetary surveillance system also demonstrates some of the challenges that this process will face.
<br><br>
The Commission will review the budgets by the end of November and publish its opinion on the compliance with fiscal rules. It can publicly request the revision of any budget deemed out of line with medium-term targets. 15 October was the deadline for eurozone members to publish draft budgets for review under the so-called "Two Pack" regulations that came into force at the end of May.<br><br>

In line with the new rules, the Commission's assessment will focus on the structural fiscal position, filtering out cyclical and one-off effects. However, the calculation of the structural position, especially measuring the output gap in real time, is analytically challenging and several issues have been raised by the European Central Bank regarding the Commission's methodology. A fiscal rule that is not based on a directly observable target is less transparent.
<br><br>
For example, according to Italy's draft budget the structural deficit in 2013 will be only 0.4% of the GDP, while the headline deficit will be very close to 3%. Financing needs are determined by headline deficits that remain wide in all periphery countries, and ultimately drive debt dynamics and determine debt sustainability. Economic growth also remains vitally important in securing debt sustainability.
<br><br>
In its latest Eurozone Snapshot, Fitch forecast debt to continue to increase beyond 2015 in Cyprus, Spain, Portugal, Slovenia and the Netherlands.
<br><br>
Medium-term public debt projections remain a key factor driving our individual sovereign ratings, but the new budgetary surveillance process is also part of the moves to reform and enhance economic governance in the eurozone as a whole. The fact that this week's deadline was met by all eurozone members suggests a strong commitment to the new enhanced fiscal framework. But the real test of its effectiveness will be to improve debt sustainability in all member states, and that has yet to be seen.<br><br>

	<hr><br>
	
24 Sep 2013 11:59 AM<br><br>
2020 Olympics Add Momentum for Japan Gaming Liberalization<br><br>
Fitch Ratings-New York-24 September 2013: The selection of Tokyo as the site for the 2020 Olympics provided the latest material catalyst for the legalization of integrated resort casinos in Japan, according to Fitch Ratings. Japan casino legalization could result in funding, development, and construction risk for potential gaming license bidders in the near term, as well as increased competitive risk to established markets and operators in the region in the long term.
<br><br>
The Olympic timing has spurred a heightened sense of urgency to support near-term gaming legislation among political proponents and industry participants as a bidding/licensing process could take 1-2 years while development/construction could take 3-4 years. Japanese legislators may introduce a gaming bill later this year for passage next year.
<br><br>
Japan has long been touted as an attractive gaming market with a large, relatively rich population base; international appeal as a tourist destination; and an established gambling industry largely consisting of pachinko/pachislo, lotteries and racing. Based on these factors, Japan has potential to rival if not surpass Singapore as the second largest gaming market in the region.<br><br>

The country has close proximity to South Korea, where gaming by nationals is restricted, and northern provinces/cities of China, including Beijing. We believe the South Korea gaming market would take the biggest negative hit should Japanese gaming liberalization occur.<br><br>

Macau, the largest casino gaming market in the world, will remain insulated because more than 53% of its 28.1 million visitors last year came from nearby Hong Kong and the province of Guangdong, indicating that Macau remains largely a day trip, local market. Still, Japanese casinos would likely target and attract a broad southeast Asian and international visitor base, so Macau would feel some limited pressure.<br><br>

Japan is likely to seek to imitate the success of the Singapore gaming market, where the broader international visitor base and large-scale, limited-license, integrated resort model results in a significantly higher percentage of revenues from non-gaming sources compared to Macau. That would seemingly favor financially strong operators such as Las Vegas Sands and Genting, which own Marina Bay Sands and Resorts World Sentosa, respectively.<br><br>

However, Fitch expects all major global and local gaming companies to seek participation based on the market's attractiveness. Other US-based multinational gaming companies, including Wynn Resorts and MGM Resorts as well as Macau-centric companies such as Melco Crown, SJM, and Galaxy Entertainment, are also likely to aggressively pursue licenses.<br><br>

Local operators and gaming suppliers such as Universal Entertainment, Sega Sammy, and Konami; as well as local real estate companies could also look to participate. Financially strapped Caesars Entertainment, which is the largest US domestic operator, has also expressed interest after missing out on previous Asia growth opportunities.<br><br>

The competing interests and varying value propositions of the parties involved could result in bidding partnerships. Credit profiles for winning bidders will benefit over the long term from increased diversification and participation in an attractive with a good likelihood of generating strong returns on invested capital. Losing bidders will incur wasted development/professional expense and face potential increased competition.<br><br>

The potential reward is certainly compelling, but does not come without material near-to-medium term risk due to the long-cycle and large-scale project nature of the bidding/development process. For example, CityCenter in Las Vegas (LV) was announced in 2004 and completed in 2009 amid the global recession and increasing supply on the LV Strip. The project contributed to MGM teetering on the brink of bankruptcy.<br><br>

We have a favorable view of the Asia-Pacific region's economic prospects over the medium term and we believe the region's gaming market is quite deep with ample room for additional penetration. However, supply growth will catch up to demand at some point. It is difficult to predict when this will occur, but it is probable that supply growth will continue throughout the region for some time.<br><br>

Macau's next phase of development on the Cotai Strip will open in 2015-2017, while the Philippines gaming market will continue to ramp up materially over the next few years (and Vietnam to a lesser extent). Gaming exclusivity periods in Australia and Singapore expire toward the end of the decade, which could result in additional supply. Russia is currently receiving interest on casino developments in Vladivostok near northern China, while South Korea and Taiwan have also been considering gaming liberalization measures.<br><br>

Gaming expansion tends to be contagious, albeit lumpy in its trajectory. Fitch continues to believe gaming proliferation in the Asia-Pacific region over the next decade may be similar to the growth over the past 20-25 years of various gaming markets in the now-saturated U.S.<br><br>

Macao Remains Resilient Amid Chinese Rebalancing<br><br>
Fitch Ratings-Hong Kong/Singapore-19 September 2013: Macao has remained largely unaffected by the slowdown in China, highlighting the economy's underlying credit resilience, says Fitch Ratings. Stronger-than-expected economic performance so far this year is underpinned by a competitive gaming industry and continuing strength in income growth in neighbouring China - the largest origin of visitors for tourism and gaming-dependent Macao.<br><br>

Macao's real GDP was up by 10.5% year-on-year in H113. Activity was boosted by a 16% surge in gaming revenue (in line with the pace from a year ago), and reflected in the steady rise in tourism and service exports. We now see upside risk to our full-year forecast of 8.5% growth.<br><br>

A key reason for the growth outperformance has been the strong flow of visitor arrivals. In the first seven months of this year, overall visitor arrivals were up 4% over the same period the year before, with those from China up 10% - higher than the 7% a year before. The share of Chinese tourists now accounts for about 60% of the total. Therefore the inflow and spending proclivity of Chinese tourists has become increasingly important for the health of Macao's gaming industry, and its overall economy.<br><br>

Macao's numbers shed light on the broader issue of China's economic health and rebalancing. Fitch believes that a fundamental aspect for China to successfully rebalance, without raising credit concerns, is for consumption growth to hold up. Macao's numbers, although reflecting only a small part of the story, nonetheless point to steady Chinese household consumption.<br><br>

Another reason for Macao's resilience is the rising importance of the mass market business in its gaming sector. This increasingly insulates the economy from a downturn in the VIP segment which is more susceptible to an official crackdown on shadow banking in China. Additional infrastructure improvement and the development of Henqin Island should support mass market growth in excess of VIP growth for the foreseeable future.<br><br>

Moreover, the gaming industry remains supply-constrained relative to demand. This provides a buffer, and allows operators to re-segment capacity toward either the mass market or VIP segment. Finally, casino operators' healthy balance sheets provide scope to subsidise financing to VIP junkets in the event of a downturn in activity.<br><br>

The upshot is that Macao's economy and credit profile have remained firm despite its heavy reliance on the gaming sector and high exposure to China country risk. This reflects a reasonably steady consumption picture in China as well as intrinsic industry strengths, which provides a buffer against any unexpected downturn.<br><br>

Taiwan's Growth Pick-up to Bypass Banks<br><br>
Fitch Ratings-Taipei/Hong Kong/Singapore-18 September 2013: Taiwan's economy has begun to pick up, but commercial banks are unlikely reap much credit benefit, says Fitch Ratings. The improving momentum in activity, through 2014, should remain underpinned by better US and EU growth and expanding business opportunities in China. However, the domestic economy - and banks' risk profiles - remain hamstrung by high private leverage, excess capacity and relatively sluggish prospects for Taiwan's SMEs.<br><br>

The main challenge for the banks arises from the large existing stock of private credit. At 165% of GDP at end-2012, this was higher than the 'A' or 'AA' rated peer medians of 94% and 119%, respectively. As nearly one-half of these loans are property related, further lending in this sector would be of questionable quality.<br><br>
The unsustainability of a credit-driven and property-related uplift in Taiwanese banks' prospects is underscored by two adverse trends.<br><br>

First, mortgage debt accounts for nearly 80% of total property loans, and has risen to levels where households' debt servicing has become vulnerable to a shift in interest rates. At 122% of disposable income, Taiwanese households are now more indebted than in all their regional peers except for Korea and Japan. Fitch estimates that a 200bp increase in borrowing costs would raise debt-servicing from a current 38% of disposable income to around 45%. This is a level of stress which nears that of Taiwan's 2005-2006 credit card crisis.<br><br>

Second, macro-prudential measures have been moderately successful at best. Tighter loan-to-value (LTV) ratios and luxury taxes have been implemented for curbing property market speculation and ensuring the soundness of the banks. But, in the absence of further monetary tightening, these measures have not quelled property price increases to below the growth in personal incomes. This trend has persisted for most of the last decade, placing the high level of household indebtedness under continuing upward pressure.<br><br>

Another challenge for the banks is the dearth of substantial or high-margin lending opportunities in the corporate sector. This is because large companies are able to raise their own financing, especially in the technology sector, which is driving much of the export-led economic recovery. As a result, the competition among Taiwanese banks to lend to smaller, domestically oriented SMEs (which tend to be somewhat less profitable or more highly geared) is likely to remain high. This means that any benefits for Taiwanese banks, amid the anticipated economic upturn, will be muted by the tough market pricing in the SME sector.<br><br>

One glimmer of hope is that the improving cross-straits relationship is resulting in greater access for smaller Taiwanese companies to the large China market. But the benefits, for SMEs' earnings profiles, could take several more years. In the meanwhile, an aggressive ramping-up of Taiwanese banks' asset exposure to the less-developed credit market in China could weigh on their risk profiles.<br><br>

Finally, Taiwan remains an overbanked market and we do not foresee further efficiency gains any time soon as large-scale consolidation is not on the cards. Banking fragmentation will continue to drive high competition. This will also fuel the risk of adverse selection, pressurise operating margins and, therefore, limit the upside gains from an anticipated economic upturn.<br><br>

Success of Abenomics is Crucial for Mega-Bank Performance<br><br>
Fitch Ratings-Hong Kong/Singapore-16 September 2013: Growing optimism over Japan's macroeconomic prospects does not automatically result in an immediate improvement in the performance or risk profiles of Japan's three mega banks - Mitsubishi UFJ, Sumitomo Mitsui and Mizuho - says Fitch Ratings. The economy is showing early signs of a turnaround. However, a sustained pick-up in domestic lending activity is still some way off, in light of Japan's unfolding structural economic reforms.<br><br>

One reason to expect subdued loan demand for the foreseeable future is the excess liquidity at Japanese corporations. This is reflected in the net cash position of the corporate sector, which was at a five-year high at JPY62tn (or 13% of GDP) at end-June. Nearly one-half of this was funded by internal capital generation.<br><br>

Another reason for our current scepticism is that we do not expect much of an increase in household lending. This is because it is difficult to foresee a strong or sustained rebound in household loan demand until Japan's structural reforms successfully increase inflation expectations, along with commensurate or larger increases in labour income.<br><br>

Meanwhile, low onshore interest rates are likely to persist. This, alongside a sluggish pace of loan growth, will limit much improvement in the margins of the mega banks' core domestic operations.
<br><br>
The mega-banks have reduced their investments in Japanese Government Bonds (JGBs) to about 3x of their Tier 1 capital at end-June from 4x at end-March. This resulted from JGB buybacks by the Bank of Japan (BOJ) as part of its continuing efforts to double the monetary base by 2014. The banks' excess cash, from the proceeds of JGB sales, has been re-parked at the BOJ's current account - whose balance has risen sharply to JPY35tn or 7.3% of GDP at end-June, up from 2.5% a year ago.<br><br>

It remains to be seen if these excess funds will eventually be lent onshore, or be used for funding greater cross-border activity.<br><br>

The mega-banks' JGB investments remain substantial despite the recent reduction. These are unlikely to fall much further amid the absence of stronger near-term onshore loan demand. But risks arising from large JGB holdings should remain contained by the banks' tight duration management, matched with ongoing improvement in capital buffers.<br><br>

Favourable stock market conditions, reflecting investors' expectations for future economic recovery, could indeed boost the mega-banks' mark-to-market gains. But this is unlikely to speed up further reduction in their stock investments and ease related market risk. The mega banks have already lowered their equity exposure to around 25%-30% of Tier 1 capital, from over 100% a few years ago. The remaining exposure is important for maintaining business relations with issuers, and will prove difficult to sell down.

	<b><a name="T13">China Gas Deals Credit Positive for Gazprom, Novatek</a> </b><br>

China Gas Deals Credit Positive for Gazprom, Novatek<br><br>
Fitch Ratings-Moscow/London-10 September 2013: The gas supply agreements that China has signed with Gazprom and Novatek are positive for the long-term credit profile of both companies, and indicate a willingness by China to invest directly in Russian natural gas, Fitch Ratings says.<br><br>

The Gazprom deal with China National Petroleum Company (CNPC) creates a legally binding agreement to supply natural gas after years of negotiations even if it did not settle the issue of price for the exports. Final agreement is expected by the end of the year, Gazprom Chief Executive Alexey Miller said last week in a statement in St Petersburg.
<br><br>
For Gazprom, the deal offers the twin benefit of opening up access to a fast-growing market and reducing the group's reliance on exports to Europe. The Russian company is facing rising competition in Europe, and comes under regular pressure from customers to cut prices by removing the link in its contracts between gas prices and oil prices. We have previously said, therefore, that agreeing a deal on gas sales to China would be an important step in strengthening Gazprom's credit profile in the long term.<br><br>

The cost of developing fields and building a pipeline to supply up to an initial annual 38 billion cubic metres of gas to China will be around USD50bn to USD60bn over four years. This is roughly equivalent to one and a half years of Gazprom's current capex. Much of this spending is already factored into our forecasts, and we believe China will be willing to help fund the construction - possibly by pre-paying for some of the gas or providing long-term financing at attractive terms.
<br><br>
China's main supplier of imported pipeline gas is Turkmenistan, with about 21 billion cubic metres in 2012. We believe that Gazprom may over time become a leading supplier of natural gas to China, delivered both through the pipeline and in the form of LNG.<br><br>

This expectation that China will help provide project funding is supported by a separately signed agreement between Novatek and CNPC. Under those terms, CNPC will not only take 3 million tons of LNG annually, but it will also buy a 20% stake in the Yamal project and will reportedly assist with raising funds for the project. The deal marks the first large-scale equity investment by China in a Russian natural gas project.
<br><br>
A final investment decision on Yamal is still to be taken, but the deal greatly increases the chances that the project will be completed successfully. This would be positive for Novatek's 'BBB-' rating, which is currently limited by the company's smaller scale relative to its peers. It is also a further strong indication that Russia is likely to relax Gazprom's monopoly on LNG exports by allowing independent gas producers to sell their gas directly to customers, although we expect Gazprom's monopoly on pipeline exports to Europe to remain in place.<br><br>

	<b><a name="T14">China's Securitisation Reforms Have a Long Way to Go</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>

China's Securitisation Reforms Have a Long Way to Go<br><br>
Fitch Ratings-Hong Kong/Singapore-06 September 2013: China's State Council announced several measures last week, which could signal an intensifying commitment to developing its securitisation market, says Fitch Ratings. These include steps to boost market liquidity, broaden the investor base, and enhance regulatory and risk controls.
<br><br>
However, Fitch feels that rapid development will remain inhibited in the short term. This is for three crucial reasons.
<br><br>
First, the market remains structurally fragmented by the existence of two securitisation frameworks in China - the Credit Asset Securitization (CAS) scheme and the Specific Asset Management Plan (SAMP) - which are governed by different regulatory authorities. Furthermore, the authorities apply different guidelines on the two frameworks with respect to eligible originators, underlying assets, and the investor base.
<br><br>
Second, legal enforceability and bankruptcy-remoteness in SAMP transactions remain unclear. This stems from an absence of comprehensive rules on the transfer of asset title for various (underlying) asset types under the SAMP framework.
<br><br>
Third, the government remains cautious about the pace of development of the securitisation market. This is because the authorities would like to see the market develop at a steady pace while still retaining control over the risks of securitisation.
<br><br>
The recently announced measures are still significant. Notably, the proposal to allow securitised products to be traded on stock exchanges would boost liquidity. It would not only facilitate a real-time market-based pricing of these products, but also raise the number of investors and provide a wider selection of investment options.
<br><br>
Moreover, the proposal to limit stock exchange-traded securitisation notes to "high quality" assets would facilitate a relatively stable portfolio performance. Thereby, it would also potentially enhance funding options for participating banks (originators of the underlying assets), and provide at least an incremental benefit to balance-sheet flexibility.
<br><br>
Finally, the State Council's intention to strengthen control over the securitisation market makes sense in that it would enhance oversight of related authorities, improve current laws and regulations, as well as standardise and tighten product guidelines. In turn, these should support investors' confidence in - and the overall liquidity of - the securitisation market.
<br><br>
What these measures will not do is facilitate any meaningful risk transfer from the banking system. Unless quotas are lifted dramatically, the small size of China's securitisation market (less than 0.1% of total assets) means any attempt at "cleaning up" the country's banks by a large-scale transfer of NPLs could be problematic - given problems with pricing such assets and the potential for overwhelming what is a fledgling market.
<br><br>
Fitch does not currently rate any securitised debt in China. The agency feels that the recent statements from the State Council, while lacking greater detail, are of considerable significance. However, this does not go far enough to radically alter the size or structure of the securitisation market - nor does it carry any huge near-term implications for China's overall financial system.
