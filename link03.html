Hillary Rodham Clinton<br><br>
US Secretary of State (2009-13)<br><br>
Chair: Dr Robin Niblett<br><br>
Director, Chatham House<br><br>
11 October 2013<br><br>

Robin Niblett:<br><br>
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Chatham House. Thank you very much for joining us today.<br><br>
It’s my great honour to welcome Hillary Rodham Clinton to Chatham House. Welcome here to our institute. It’s a pleasure to welcome you here not just to have a conversation with us, but as the winner of the Chatham House Prize 2013. [applause]<br><br>
Hillary Rodham Clinton:<br><br>
Thank you. Thank you so very much.<br><br>
Robin Niblett:<br><br>
What I like about our prize, even though our board sometimes gets a little nervous, is that it is from a selection of candidates nominated by our research programmes. Then our presidents narrow it down to three people and our members vote. The members are here, they voted for you, so it makes it a very special, I think, prize. As you know, it was given to you for your great, significant contributions to international diplomacy but also C I know this is important to you as well C for your role promoting the rights of women and girls and equal opportunities for them in the world.<br><br>
This evening we’re going to celebrate the award of the prize at a formal event, which lets us have an informal conversation today. I’m very glad that you would be so kind, on an often on-the-record format at Chatham House, to be able to have this conversation with us today. We could go anywhere, so what I’m going to do is start off by just kicking off with a few questions that I will ask. Hopefully I will leave a whole bunch of things C people are already putting their hands up, this is a very bad sign. So hang on for 20 minutes or so because this is the way we’re going to do it. We’ve got time. I probably won’t take more than 20 minutes, hopefully I won’t take up all of your questions. I’ll do a fair amount of filibustering so the cameras will get a little quieter in a minute as well.<br><br>
We could go in many directions, not least because I think, if I may say, Secretary Clinton, you kind of played two very fundamental roles as secretary of state. Strategically, I think the rebalance C let’s use that phrase C of American foreign policy from the Middle East in particular to the Asia-Pacific was clearly one of the big strategic calling cards of your tenure as secretary. But you were also involved very much in the trenches, having to make lastminute calls, tough calls, through the process, which is the job of a secretary of state. But to have blended those two things, and we can therefore talk in our conversation about grand strategy with you, and we can also end up talking about some of those really tough calls you had to make as you go along. I hope we can draw out the insights of your experience for the future and not just for how things went on at that time.<br><br>
Let me kick off therefore with a kind of big question. When you took up your position as secretary of state, US leadership C and this was one of your calling cards, I think the phrase you used was that there were questions about the future of America’s global leadership. You wanted to be able to renew the commitment to the tools of diplomacy, engage with allies, etc. Today, certainly if I look at the world, I’d say America C powerful country. Probably easily still the most powerful. Shale gas, military bases all over the world. Strong alliances and allies. But at the same time, we’ve got shutdown. We’ve got the nearly but not Syria vote. I’d say fears outside the US of a neo-isolationist instinct perhaps creeping into the body politic, and maybe a fear that America still plays by its own rules. The PRISM intelligence-gathering issue has really C I keep hearing it in conferences, it keeps coming up in conversations about America’s role.<br><br>
So with that big set-up, do you think America has the capacity for global leadership today? Can it play a leadership role of the sort that you hoped it would when you took office four years ago?<br><br>
Hillary Rodham Clinton:<br><br>
First, Robin, let me thank you and thank the members of Chatham House for this very moving award. I am a fan of your work and I appreciate greatly the vote of the membership on my behalf.<br><br>
I think the question is one that has a very simple answer: yes, America’s leadership remains not only preeminent but necessary. But the world in which we live poses new challenges to all of us on an ongoing basis that require a level of strategic thinking and execution that starts, first and foremost, back in the democracies that we represent. So I would never criticize my country out of my country, but let me say that it is distressing at any point to see a political system that has weathered so many crises over centuries now be caught up in what are very unfortunate partisan disputes. However, underlying them are questions about America’s direction at home and abroad, and I am confident that we will work our way through this latest challenge as we did back during my husband’s administration in 1995 and early 1996.<br><br>

But I think that there’s an underlying concern C and it’s not only in our country, because we didn’t take a vote but you did C that raises issues about, what are our responsibilities? How do we project power in the 21st century which is both traditional forms as well as new, so-called soft or (what I like to say) smart power? Those are debates that societies have to have, not just inside government offices.<br><br>
So I’m looking forward to talking in specifics with you but I think it’s fair to say that the concerns that we have to be aware of when we look at the international position of the United States have to really come from a wellspring of effective decision-making at home. That’s economic and it’s social: growing inequality; the sense that in the United States and in Europe there is an ongoing debate about how we continue to provide the best services at the most affordable cost to our citizens, because that after all is really the core of what we can do around the world. So I’m confident but I think that the debate we’re having is one that requires some very serious analysis and thought.<br><br>
Robin Niblett:<br><br>
Does it cramp the style of a foreign secretary C of a secretary of state C the fact that this domestic dimension of international politics is so powerful today? We’ve got publics who have been battered by global financial crisis, by at least not-good handling of some key international crises (Iraq, Afghanistan C how they were managed, at the very least). Therefore the room or scope for leadership is minimal. Presidents or prime ministers find that they want to do a world of summitry, take the lead. The role of the secretary of state and foreign secretary must be quite a difficult one in terms of being able to follow through and lead. How did you find that kind of role as a secretary of state in particular?<br><br>
Hillary Rodham Clinton:<br><br>
I didn’t find it difficult C I found it very challenging, because of course I took office when President Obama was sworn in, in the midst of the economic crisis. I think it’s easy for many to forget how close the world came to a much more serious, long-lasting economic recession, even depression. I think it was something that required American leadership. I’m certainly aware that some of the reasons for it lay in American financial decision-making and perhaps lack of regulatory oversight. But the fact is that when I came into the position, the president and I talked very openly with each other about how important it was for me to get out around the world at that moment, making it clear that we had confidence, we were going to recover, while the president had to deal with the Congress and the immediate effects of the economic crisis.<br><br>
That’s basically what I did for much of the first year, starting, as you say, by going to Asia, which was unusual if not unprecedented for an American secretary of state. But it was an important message to send, in part because China, which to this day has heavily invested in American debt, was raising questions and wondering about the decisions that would be made by the new administration. There was a feeling that because of the war in Iraq and the aftermath of 9/11 and then of course Afghanistan, the United States had shifted attention away from Asia, and that was of concern to a lot of our allies. In Europe there was also a worry: the contagion of the economic crisis plus what was felt to be a less-than-ongoing level of attention from the prior administration. So I went to Asia and then I immediately came to Europe. In part to consult and to hear out what people had to say but also to convey a message that we were looking at the entire world. Of course we will always be concerned about the Middle East C we had a war to wind down and a war to try to resolve, and so that was very much on the forefront of the National Security Council’s agenda. But we wanted to get back into a more cooperative, consultative role with our allies and partners, and frankly to send messages to others.<br><br>
Robin Niblett:<br><br>
Just on this point about that trip to Asia and the role that you played in the pivoting or rebalancing of US foreign policy toward a more balanced look toward the Asia-Pacific. You mentioned China and the need to keep China sort of feeling onside. You pushed this Strategic and Economic Dialogue C you added the ‘strategic’ part to it, which was important C but at the same time you were a very forceful advocate for, let’s say, your ASEAN allies, those allies in Southeast Asia (the Philippines, Singapore and other countries there). How do you balance that wanting to send the positive message, let’s say, to your ASEAN allies with the fact that China may be seeing this part of the world more as its area? It looked at this pivot pretty suspiciously. Did you feel this in your meetings with Chinese leaders?<br><br>

Hillary Rodham Clinton:<br><br>
Oh yes, I did. There were concerns on the part of the Chinese leadership over what this meant. But when I planned that first trip and presented this strategy to the White House, I wanted to integrate what were different strands of our involvement. There’s a very strong argument that a rising China has to be the central focus of American foreign policy in the Asia-Pacific and increasingly even globally, the hope being that through that kind of involvement we can move, as Bob Zoellick has said, toward China becoming a responsible stakeholder. There were our traditional allies: we have treaty alliances with Japan, South Korea, Thailand, the Philippines, Australia. There was a feeling on their part that we needed to be much clearer about what American interests would be in the 21st century; that we were a resident Pacific power, that we had obligations and we needed to more forcefully present those. Then there were the ASEAN countries, some of whom we had alliances with, but which was a much larger group that was looking to try to figure out how to do their own balancing.<br><br>
So what I said was I didn’t think you could pick among those choices, that you had to have a more comprehensive approach. Partly because we had existing obligations but also because, it seemed to me, as we charted our course forward with China, we wanted China to realize that we were in the Pacific to stay. We were there not as an interloper but as a participant, and therefore we wanted to become more involved in the regional organizations. On that first trip I went to Jakarta and signed a memorandum saying that the United States would move toward the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation, something we had never done but which was very important to the ASEAN nations, and indeed in China began what was a very candid conversation. I think there were certainly some areas of disagreement. We know about China’s historical interests (Taiwan, Tibet) which they always raise with the United States, their sensitivity about human rights C all of which were on the agenda. But then we were looking, through this new vehicle of the Strategic and Economic Dialogue, to take what Hank Paulson had done on the economic side and, with Tim Geithner and I working together, to expand the discussion. Because I think the Chinese would have been very happy to stay focused on the economic issues. In early 2009, part of that was: you guys are going to get your house in order, aren’t you? You’re going to make sure that our investments in your debt are good ones?<br><br>
But also, we wanted to bring the strategic in, because there’s a long list: claims in the South China Sea, claims in the East China Sea, the conflicts that have occurred over assets and potential resources with Vietnam and the Philippines, the back-and-forth arguing with Japan. The continuing threat posed by North Korea, which is very much of a Chinese problem and potentially a solution. So we wanted to broaden the aperture so that we weren’t just talking about currency revaluation. We wanted to have a broader discussion and we wanted it made clear that the United States was there to stay.<br><br>

Robin Niblett:<br><br>
There was a moment there when you must have wondered if this was all going to be able to hang together. It struck me as one of the most remarkable moments of your time as secretary of state with China, those few months at the beginning of 2012 when Wang Lijun C the vice-mayor of Chongqing, Bo Xilai’s right-hand guy C sort of gave himself up to the US embassy in Beijing, which you had to handle in a particular way. Then three or four months later, Chen Guangcheng had to be kind of rescued into the embassy, if I can put it that way. That was just before you were going to land for your next Strategic and Economic Dialogue. Can you give us a feel for how you managed that particular process?<br><br>
Hillary Rodham Clinton:<br><br>
It’s always a challenge when things that are totally unexpected happen. I like to have these virtual inboxes in my head: the immediate screaming crisis, the brewing crisis and the long-term crisis. Then I also try to keep a big box of opportunities. But it is a great example of the way I think the expanded Strategic and Economic Dialogue helped us resolve two very difficult issues, because what I tried to do in the Dialogue is to really embed in the governments of both of our countries issues, so that there was a lot more interchange. I came to believe that the Chinese, for their own reasons and because of their own way of governing, believed that somewhere in Washington there is a master plan about what we intend to do to try to control their rise. I see my friend Kevin Rudd sitting in the front row; he and I have talked about that endlessly. They really do, because they have plans and they have all kinds of processes. They have never understood the jazz-like quality of American government and democracy.<br><br>
So what I tried to do is to begin to sort of strip away some of the misconceptions. We do have views, we have interests, we have values C but we’re not opaque, we want to share with you and we want you to begin to share a little more with us. So when, as you say, Bo Xilai’s right hand, the police chief, showed up in a consulate (not the embassy, showed up in a consulate) asking for asylum because his story, which you know was quite dramatic, about him knowing that Bo Xilai’s wife had killed one of your countrymen C he did not fit any of the categories for the United States giving him asylum. He had a record of corruption, of thuggishness, brutality. He was an enforcer for Bo Xilai. They may have had a falling-out and now he was trying to somehow get his way to a place of safety. But on the other hand, the consulate was quickly encircled by other police who were either subordinate to Bo Xilai or looking to curry favour. So it was becoming a very dangerous situation.<br><br>
So what we did was to tell him that he could not move into the consulate, that there were no grounds on which we could offer that to him. But he kept saying that he wanted to get the truth to Beijing, he wanted the government in Beijing to know what was happening. So we said: we can arrange that. So indeed that’s what we did. We were very discreet about it and did not try to embarrass anybody involved in it, but tried to handle it in a very professional manner, which I think we accomplished.<br><br>
Fast forward: I get called late, late one night about Chen, who has escaped from house arrest C quite remarkably, since he’s blind C had broken his foot in the escape, had been picked up and was seeking asylum in our embassy in Beijing, and was on his way there. Of course, we knew of his courageous history of dissident activity. We knew he was a self-taught lawyer who had very bravely taken on the one-child policy of China, suing local officials and others for their behaviour. It was, as you say, about a week before our annual Strategic and Economic Dialogue meeting, this time in Beijing. I was very well aware that this would be an issue in the relationship, but I also believed that this was an example of American values in practice. This was a man who, yes, deserved American support and attention and protection.<br><br>
So lots of back and forth, as you can imagine, and then I finally just made the call. I said: we’re going to send our people out to go pick him up. So there was a rendezvous, we got him into the embassy, got him medical treatment for some of his injuries. Then had to tell the Chinese government that we were offering hospitality to one of their citizens and would love to talk to them about it. Kurt Campbell, who some of you know, who was my assistant secretary for Asian and Pacific affairs, immediately got on a plane. We were fortunate that Harold Koh, the head of my legal department and an incredible international lawyer with his own history of dissidence C his father was unable to return home from his position at the UN because of a coup in Korea C he had a feel for this. We tracked him down, he was at one of our Strategic and Economic Dialogue working groups. So we got our people to the embassy and they began talking with Mr Chen, and then they began negotiating with their Chinese counterparts.<br><br>
This is a long story, I don’t want to take all of our time, but it was a very touching and touch-and-go situation. We were able to negotiate with the Chinese safe passage for his family C he hadn’t seen one of his children for quite some time C to Beijing. We were able to negotiate an agreement that he could attend college, something he really wanted to do, and he did not want to leave China. He loves China. He actually also very much believes that if he could just get his story to the upper echelon of the Chinese government, they would agree with him, because so much of the mistreatment he experienced was at the hands of local and regional officials. So our team did a great job negotiating all of this. He did have medical problems that needed further treatment so he left our embassy, totally voluntarily. He called me from the van on the way to the hospital and said: if I were there, I would kiss you. I said: I’m very happy you’re so happy.<br><br>
Robin Niblett:<br><br>
A tactful answer.<br><br>
Hillary Rodham Clinton:<br><br>
Yes. We got him to the hospital and his family showed up. Rightfully, they were saying: are you sure you can trust the Chinese government? Are you sure that they will keep their end of the bargain? Are you sure they’re going to let you go to college, are you sure they’re not going to throw you in prison? He began C and this is a man who had been under a lot of stress now for several days C he began saying: I’m not sure, I’m not sure. So he tells us: I don’t think that’s a good deal you negotiated. Yes, I know. I said: excuse me? I mean, really. So we said: okay, what would you like? He said: I’d like to go to America. Okay. After saying no, no, no. So we worked out an arrangement that he could go to New York University to study, assuming we could get a second agreement with the Chinese. And this is where I think all the work we put into this, all of the incredible planning and one-on-one meetings and very candid conversations that I engaged in with my counterparts and others did with theirs C because I had to go to State Councillor Dai Bingguo and I had to say: this is in your interests and it’s in our interests, and there’s got to be a way we can work this out. His first response was: we never want to talk about this man again with anybody. We can’t go back into negotiations. I said: we have to, and we need to start now and we need to get this resolved by the end of our meetings.<br><br>
We did it in a way that really I think validated the kind of arrangement and the almost daily work that went into it. The final thing I would say about it, which was very touching to me C this was really touch-and-go. One of the things that I was asked to do, because I still had meetings on my agenda with President Hu Jintao and Premier Wen Jiabao, and they said: please don’t mention this to them, we will try to work this out. So I didn’t, and we had very formal, very predictable kinds of meetings. Then we were having an event of our People-to-People Exchanges. Again, I know a lot of foreign policy experts say that’s like frosting on the cake, what difference does it make? Put on your formal clothes, go into the meetings. I can only tell you that at the People-to-People event there was a young American man who was studying in China and a young Chinese woman who was studying in the United States, and we had picked them out to speak to the group (she in English, he in Mandarin) about their experiences in each other’s country. I am convinced that helped to convince the Chinese government that we would do this deal, because I said in my prepared remarks: this is what the future should be about, about young people like this working together, understanding each other better, visiting and finding common ground. That’s what we should be looking for.<br><br>
So later that afternoon we were able to make the deal and then Mr Chen and his family were able to leave. But I think it was part of a broader story, not just a one-off.<br><br>
Robin Niblett:<br><br>
But I think the story, which is fascinating, is, as you said, an absolute example of that thickening of relationships C what diplomacy, I suppose, is about.<br><br>
Hillary Rodham Clinton:<br><br>
Right.<br><br>
Robin Niblett:<br><br>
Diplomacy is meant to be about actual results C to get to them, you have to go through such a process of confidence-building.<br><br>

Hillary Rodham Clinton:<br><br>
Right. We are such an impatient people these days. This seems like it’s just like the Weber comment about politics: the dull, slow boring of hard boards. It seems like it just goes on and on and really, the tenth meeting and the eighteenth dinner. In a way, I think it’s more important to show up today than it used to be, because everybody knows you can communicate via technology without showing up. People would say to me all the time: what are you travelling all over the place for? Part of it was we had some repair work to do, to be very blunt, but part of it also was we had some relationships to build. They are worth investing in because you never know what might come from them or what you might stop coming from them. Yet I think in part because of the feeling (I’ll speak for my own country) that this is like just frosting on the cake, fine if you can do it but not necessary C and I actually think it’s baked into the cake, so to speak. If you don’t do it, you will not really understand what is possible in such a complex, fast-changing world like the one we have.<br><br>
Robin Niblett:<br><br>
I think even in the UK at the moment, there has been a rediscovery of the importance of that human component of diplomacy, alongside something I know you pushed a lot as well: the social media, the connectivity, the town hall meetings, etc. If you don’t do some of that hard graft, it becomes incredibly difficult to deal with the crises which are a core part, as you said, of your job.<br><br>
Of course I’ve got a bunch of questions about the Middle East and so on which I’m not going to tackle right now, because I’ve got a lot of people here, especially among our members, who have a chance to ask questions.<br><br>
Question 1:<br><br>
In Georgia at the same time last year, we faced huge risks of instability in the pre-election and the power transition time. Thanks to your huge efforts and those of President Obama, we managed to overcome this obstacle and now we are on the next step of our developing democracy. Since this time, there have been huge crimes uncovered that involve the previous regime’s highest officials. Our current government is under huge and nearly irresistible pressure from the West not to arrest the previous officials or be blamed for the politically motivated persecution. At the same time, the government is under pressure from the public to face justice; for the sake of democracy and rule of law, those responsible need to be brought to justice. Madame Clinton, your views are greatly appreciated in Georgia and respected. I would really be grateful if you could tell us your views and advice on how we should tackle this obstacle on our way to building a healthier democracy in Georgia.<br><br>
Hillary Rodham Clinton:<br><br>
I think you’ve got a very challenging dilemma facing Georgia, and you have summarized it well. The progress that Georgia has made in the last twenty years is quite remarkable. Many of the people who contributed to that progress are currently out of office and you have a new government that understandably wants to continue the progress and figure out the best way to do that. I can’t give you the kind of easy answer that would say X or Y, because there is so much riding on how you navigate through these next months in terms of your stability, in terms of whether or not you can, as you say, protect the rule of law without undermining a lot of the progress that has been made. That takes a lot of very careful thought that has to be depersonalized. You have to think not of the people who you believe may have broken laws, but think about the positions that are currently being held by the new government and whether pursuing prior officeholders is going to consolidate democracy or rip the country into a lot of pieces.<br><br>
What I would ask you to do is to try to avoid personalizing it and instead to try to, in effect, analyse what will be in the best interests of Georgia in five years, ten years, fifteen years. Because for every person you say wants you to do something, there is a person who thinks it would be very unfortunate if you did. You have to sort that out. There are truth and reconciliation commission models, there are other kinds of inquiries that could make things public so that it would serve the purpose of transparency but not create the kind of instability and maybe even conflict that could undermine the democratic project in Georgia.<br><br>
Question 2:<br><br>
You spoke nicely about the jazz quality of American foreign policy. On Syria, one would think it’s more like a dissonant 12-tone scale. I wondered if you thought that the deal, however it was reached, on chemical weapons was an irrelevance to the real problem, which is the civil war, or whether you think it actually can be a step toward resolving it. Thank you.<br><br>

Hillary Rodham Clinton:<br><br>
I think at this point it can be and should be a step toward resolving it. I do think it on its own has merit. Ridding or at least fully acknowledging and trying to contain Syria’s chemical capacity is very important for the ongoing civil war but also for the potential dangers to neighbours. That can be put into the category of a positive outcome of the ongoing negotiations.<br><br>
Syria is in part such a dilemma because there has not yet been a willingness on the part of the Russians to really push the Assad regime, the Iranians to rein in their own support for the Syrian military, the opposition to organize themselves sufficiently to present a united front that would provide negotiators on the Syrian side. So the fact that Russia and the United States and the rest of the world have cooperated on this chemical weapons endeavour, I think, is a plus toward leading perhaps into the Geneva II negotiations.<br><br>
I negotiated Geneva I, and it was a roadmap for a transition. Sergey Lavrov was there, he agreed to it. I know he left the room and went to the Russian embassy and made a secure phone call so I believe he was authorized to agree to it. It was our understanding that we would take that and have it somehow blessed by the Security Council so that it would have the imprimatur not just of the Syrian Group, which included all the members of the Security Council, but the broader community. That did not happen. It did not happen in part because, I think, the Russians were not yet ready and Assad was not ready to make that kind of commitment to a process, and the process would be a transition process away from him.<br><br>
But you know, time has passed. More terrible things have happened. The refugee numbers are skyrocketing. Jordan is under tremendous pressure, Turkey is doing an excellent but strained job trying to deal with all of the refugees. You’ve got Iraq playing a role on the side of Iran and Assad that is quite troubling. Lebanon has all kinds of challenges. So you go around the region and you see that we’re not at a stable situation, we’re in a continuing, deteriorating situation.<br><br>
So I think that this level of cooperation, which actually just won a Nobel Prize so obviously people see it as something worthwhile, can lead to a better outcome at Geneva II, which might lead to a political resolution. You’ve got two big problems. You still don’t have an opposition that controls very much and you have an increasingly well-armed militancy that answers to other than the Syrian people, which will be the spoilers unless they are reined in. So we are a long way from seeing some kind of positive outcome but I think the chemical weapons piece is a good step.<br><br>


Robin Niblett:<br><br>
Just to press on this point quickly: can you have a credible part of the opposition, which you’ll need for a negotiation, without that credible part continuing to be armed or better armed? I say the ‘credible’ part of the opposition for the obvious reason. You backed, about a year-plus ago, then Defense Secretary Panetta and General Dempsey when they were kind of pushing that. That was then, people say now’s now. We’ve lost the bubble, we’ve lost the moment. Do you think we’ve lost the moment? Can you actually have a credible, more positive opposition without backing them? And I mean, backing them militarily as well.<br><br>
Hillary Rodham Clinton:<br><br>
It’s public information that I pushed very hard to have a mission on the part of the United States and others to try to work with credible opposition to help them gain some credibility with the other rebels. That did not happen. I still think there’s an opportunity to do that and there is some work, again publicly known, that is proceeding. But what is missing is a leadership to rally around and then to really work in a concerted way to support both their political track and their military track. If I were inside Syria and I were leading some small group from my village and three others, I would want to follow someone who, yes, had a vision for a Syria that would be appealing to me post-Assad. But I wouldn’t trust that leadership if there weren’t some hard guys with weapons that would back it up, because there are a lot of other guys there with those assets. So yeah, I think you have to have an opposition that is not just talking but has some strength behind their positions.<br><br>
Question 3:<br><br>
Madame Secretary, thank you for the frankness with which you’re talking this afternoon. I want to ask you about the international institutions and whether you feel they’re strong enough for our strategic purposes and global cooperation nowadays. Or do you worry that the world and international diplomacy is becoming too ad hoc?<br><br>
Hillary Rodham Clinton:<br><br>
I do think that part of the reason that international diplomacy is ad hoc to a certain degree is because the international institutions have difficulty moving quickly on a number of strategic fronts. I’m one who thinks that if we didn’t have the United Nations we’d have to invent it. We need that role that the United Nations plays, which is absolutely, critically important for all the obvious reasons. But it is difficult to get controversial action done quickly within the Security Council. That’s why people go off on ad hoc. Now eventually they try to circle back, and that’s what happened with chemical weapons. Couldn’t get a Security Council resolution on tougher sanctions on the Assad regime, on possible Article VII action in the absence of pulling back from the offense they were on, and all the rest you know so well. But on the chemical weapons piece, that’s in everybody’s interest. If you’re Russia or China or the United States, you don’t want Syria to have a big chemical weapons stockpile, so you’d seize these opportunity and they agree and we go forward.<br><br>
So no, I think that everyone that I’ve spoken to about the international organizations knows there has to be reforms, knows that there has to be a new global social contract for the 21st century. But it’s difficult to actually put that into operation. So you’ve got the IMF and you have the G20, you’ve got the United Nations and you have regional organizations. So it looks like an alphabet soup but properly managed, there are benefits to each of those. But nothing will replace a more global framework, and it would be to everyone’s benefit if we could put our heads together, go back to Bretton Woods and figure out, okay, what does it look like for the 21st century? Go back to San Francisco and say, okay, what does the UN look like for the 21st century? I don’t think that’s likely to happen anytime soon but it’s something we should at least consider.<br><br>
Question 4:<br><br>
I want to take you back to where Robin started, on leadership. A lot of the conversations I have, people are indicating a weaker America. Allies are nervous about a weaker America. Adversaries perhaps taking advantage of what they perceive as a weaker America. But there’s an argument that says this could actually be a new form of leadership from the United States C perhaps, to use a terminology that wasn’t much liked in the US, a leading from behind or a leading together, more of a multilateral type of leadership. I’d be interested in your views on, is this a new strategic vision? Is this a new type of leadership that Obama is trying to achieve? Is this a positive move or is this a little bit more of a haphazard C ad hoc, to use Jeremy’s terminology.<br><br>

Hillary Rodham Clinton:<br><br>
I definitely think that both President Obama and myself believe that there should be more shared responsibility and there should be more multilateral leading on a range of issues. That has certainly been an approach that we’ve deployed in several instances. But I don’t think that means that we don’t recognize and accept our primary responsibility in any of those settings. Libya is an example. The Europeans came to the United States and said: we have to do something about this. The Arab League came to the United States and said: we have to do something about this. Our response was: well, what are you going to do about it? They said: we’re here to ask you what you’re going to do. Our response was: we want to know what you’re going to do.<br><br>
That sounds funny but it was the first time there had ever been any kind of partnership between NATO and Arab countries. It was the first time where the United States said: we have certain assets that are uniquely ours; we will deploy those. You have assets; you should deploy yours. I thought that was an appropriate way to respond to a problem that was certainly important to us but critically important to a lot of our allies.<br><br>
I think you can look at the kind of leadership in a way that is described as networked, which I like for a lot of reasons, including that Anne-Marie Slaughter (who was my director of policy and planning) wrote a very influential article about the move toward networked leadership in the world. It’s one of the reasons I asked her to join me at the State Department, because it’s not only ‘round up the usual suspects’ C there are other organizations and entities that have responsibility for leading. That’s true not only in foreign policy but it’s true in development policy, where what we’re doing now is trying to put together networks and partnerships to solve problems that governments alone C and even international organizations alone C would not be as effective in doing so. I just came out of the Clinton Global Initiative in New York, which was really born out of my husband’s insight when he left the White House that there were so many different players now in the world who had a role that could contribute to solving, primarily, development problems that we needed a vehicle to get them together to make commitments to do so.<br><br>
I think the same is true on the security side as well. We are never going to deal with the problems of cyber security unless there is a partnership between business and government. We’re never going to be able to deal with a lot of the trend-line problems C whether it’s terrorism or poaching or human trafficking C without having a broader network of invested players and leaders.<br><br>

So I don’t know that it’s some kind of new philosophy. It’s more a recognition that that’s the way the world is evolving. If we want to stop elephant poaching and murdering in Africa, we have to use social media to convince Asians that the tusk doesn’t fall off like a tooth but the elephant has to be killed in order to get it. You begin to engage citizens as themselves C agents as well as principals in making these decisions.<br><br>
Question 5:<br><br>
Do you think that it is right that there is a proper debate about the scrutiny and the oversight of the US and UK intelligence agencies in the light of the new technologies?<br><br>
Question 6:<br><br>
I’m curious to know what you think about this new momentum in terms of the US and Iran, and these moves that we’ve seen happening day by day C little developments that look like there could be some sort of rapprochement possibly in the not-too-distant future.<br><br>
Hillary Rodham Clinton:<br><br>
These are both very important questions, but Robin says I need to talk quickly. On the intelligence issue C we’re democracies, thank goodness, both the US and the UK. We need to have a sensible, adult conversation about what is necessary to be done and how to do it in a way that is as transparent as it can be, with as much oversight and citizen understanding as can be. I think that has to be the sort of framework, because within that framework there are some things that I know from my own experience as a senator, as a secretary of state, that really are critical ingredients in our homeland security and in helping to protect people in other countries as well. I also know, at least speaking for the United States, much more personal information about many more Americans is held by businesses in the United States than by our government.<br><br>
So how do we sort all of this out? This is a new problem. It’s a problem that’s a little over a decade old, where these capacities have corresponded with increasing outreach to consumers on the business side and increasing concern about security on the government side. So people need to be better informed but I think it would be going down a wrong path if we were to somehow reject the importance of both the debate and the kinds of intelligence activities that genuinely keep us safer. So I’m all for opening up a more vigorous discussion about it.<br><br>
With respect to Iran, I think it’s too soon to tell. Clearly the new leadership in Iran is approaching the issues in a more collegial, diplomatic way. That is certainly welcome. But there’s been no change in policy yet. There’s been no response to the outstanding offer by the P-5+1 of two years ago now. So when Cathy Ashton brings together the P-5+1 negotiating group in Geneva next week, I will be most interested in hearing if the Iranians are putting any meat on the bones of their hope that there can be a negotiation that leads to a resolution that is satisfying to them and acceptable to us. I just think we don’t have any way of knowing that yet.<br><br>
Question 7:<br><br>
Can I ask you to reflect on the changing nature of leadership, politics and diplomacy, particularly the new vulnerabilities? I think back to what you mentioned at the Human Rights Council in Geneva back in February 2011, about the new nervous system for this planet. The level of connectivity C no one can hide now, whether you’re in government in a democratically elected country or elsewhere. You’ve mentioned Anne-Marie but also Alec Ross, the work that he was doing within the State Department. There are enormous changes happening incredibly quickly, including disruption of the way leaders believe leadership should be enacted. What are your reflections now that you’ve left the State Department?<br><br>
Hillary Rodham Clinton:<br><br>
That’s a fabulous question. It deserves a Chatham House process.<br><br>
Robin Niblett:<br><br>
We’ll do one.<br><br>
Hillary Rodham Clinton:<br><br>
One of the things I have learned over the years is: watch the headlines but keep your eye on the trend-lines, because the trend-lines are often much more important. The interconnectivity along with the interdependence is very much on my mind, because the benefits are quite remarkable but so are the dangers, and how we balance that is one of the challenges of leadership.<br><br>

More transparency can help to fight corruption, can make information more readily available to people. Alec Ross was my ally in promoting internet freedom, which we believe is like Speakers’ Corner at Hyde Park or the First Amendment C something that just has to be embedded in the global consciousness. But we’ve also seen more sophisticated use of government power to interrupt internet usage, to target dissidents and opposition figures. So we’re in a formative period, the outcome of which is not yet clear.<br><br>
I think it’s imperative that governments C democracies, governments who value free speech, open debate C really unite in trying to protect this underlying value. That is going to be one of the most difficult questions that will face leaders in the next few years, because of the concerted effort by more closed societies, more controlling societies, to try to clamp down. So when you talk about leadership, I think it’s a great device for learning more about what’s going on, but it also can be a device that interferes with making tough decisions. If you are only watching how many followers you have on Twitter or whether people who are responding to your speeches like you or not, that can very much create static in the decision-making process. We’ve got to get back to really looking clearly at the underlying values that undergird our societies and our governments and not get diverted by the constant back and forth of the debate. Use it for informing people and informing yourself but don’t use it as an excuse not to make hard decisions as a leader.<br><br>
Question 8:
Russia just arrested 30 Greenpeace activists who were trying to land on a platform. What would you advise them to try and get them released? How would you go about persuading President Putin that it’s a good idea to release them?<br><br>
Robin Niblett:<br><br>
I wonder if there’s any Americans in there. I’ll let you reflect on that for a second. That sounds like one of those C is it a screaming or a loudly screaming one? You’ll have to think about it.<br><br>
Question 9:<br><br>
I’ll take you back to Syria, if you don’t mind C the Middle East is warmer than London today. The question is: by the time the Syrian crisis started in the Middle East, Turkey was the ardent supporter of United States policies to attack Syria unilaterally. However, since the crisis now is coming into slow motion, do you think Turkey C including Erdogan himself as prime minister C has been (to use a football analogy) kicked into the offside?<br><br>
Question 10:<br><br>
I would like to ask you: there are many women in Saudi Arabia that are going to defy the driving ban this month. What would you like to say to them and do you think what these women are doing will lead to a change?<br><br>
[applause]<br><br>
Robin Niblett:<br><br>
I’m glad we got a question about women’s rights. It was sitting down here in my things we never got to, but we got there in the last question.<br><br>
Hillary Rodham Clinton:<br><br>
On the piracy issue, there should be a much greater international outcry over the Russian arrest and charging the Greenpeace activists with piracy. This is both, on the merits, an issue that needs to be resolved C I know a lot of governments are intervening and speaking out C but going back to the last question, this is a great issue to use the internet over. A huge outcry of people demonstrating in favour of these folks and trying to create something of a movement on their behalf C ultimately, President Putin will decide what he thinks is in his country’s interests, but I think that needs to be balanced by a real outcry.<br><br>
But it raises a larger issue which does not get enough conversation, and that is the future of the Arctic and how it’s going to be governed, and what the rules are and who gets to devise them and enforce them. I participated in the Arctic Council, which consists of the five Arctic nations plus three neighbouring nations. We began working on agreements, like search and rescue, in the Arctic. Oil spill recovery. This is one of these issues that people are going to wake up in a couple of years and there’s going to be all kinds of things going on, and people are going to say, why didn’t we do something about this? The fact is, yes, countries have jurisdiction in their coastal waters and they can enforce their laws, but there needs to be more work done on the rules of the road, so to speak, in the Arctic. With the changes in the environment it’s going to become an increasingly trafficked part of our world.<br><br>

We had a great agreement in the 1950s on the Antarctic, which has preserved it; very different issues in the Arctic but I think C to go back to the UN question C there needs to be a much more intense effort to try to support the Arctic Council and international bodies in helping to make those rules.<br><br>
I think that Prime Minister Erdogan was a very strong supporter of the Syrian uprising but, as I’m sure you know, he had other challenges at home that he had to deal with. Among them were his ongoing efforts with the Kurds inside Turkey, and some of the activities of Kurds in Syria began to complicate that. There is also, as you know, a large Alawite population in southwestern Turkey and that began to complicate it. Everybody has politics. It doesn’t matter what kind of government you have. His politics became much more challenging for him.<br><br>
I think he remains a strong voice for the humane treatment of refugees and I think what Turkey has done in receiving so many Syrian refugees and putting them in conditions that were above what might have been expected for refugees redounds to his credit. But he’s got to sort out a lot of different challenges, and I think he remains committed, but without a broader base on which to operate I don’t think you’re going to see him able to do much more than what he’s doing right now. I think that’s unfortunate but I think if there had been more movement and at the same time a greater international effort, he might have been able to participate and lead that more effectively.<br><br>
On the Saudi women driving, I’m all for it. I think that it is an issue that is symbolic, as you know very well, but it is also C from my friends who have lived in the Kingdom, Saudi and non-Saudi alike C it is a major hassle not to be able to go anywhere. To go shopping, to go see your mother, to drive your kids somewhere C just imagine. You can’t do anything without having a driver, assuming you can afford a driver, or having a male relative who has to be around to drive you places. In today’s world it is just hard to even rationalize.<br><br>
So I’m hoping there will be a decision made to begin to let women drive. If there has to be some kind of phasing in of women drivers, as some sort of face-saving way, maybe that could be worked out. But it needs to happen and it would be an important step for the people C not just women C of Saudi Arabia becoming more competitive and more integrated into the modern world.<br><br>


Robin Niblett:<br><br>
Again, my apologies to all those people whose questions I didn’t take. I looked you in the eye, I nodded and I didn’t get there. But we got, if I may so, I thought a master class and certainly, Secretary Clinton, you’ve still got the brief mastered. That’s just fantastic to watch. I thought it was both conceptual and practical, and with feeling and humour as well. From my opinion, this makes you an extremely worthy winner of the Chatham House Prize 2013. Thank you all very much for coming and for asking great questions. Apologies to those I didn’t get to. Please a very strong hand for Secretary Clinton, Chatham House Prize 2013.<br><br>
